class: title, no-footer, smokescreen

# Crash course on Python

class: compact
# Data Types
Integers (default for numbers)
```python
z = 5 / 2 # Answer is 2, integer division.
```

Floats
```python
x = 3.14
```

Booleans
```python
a = True # or False
```

Strings
- Can use `""` or `''` . For example: `"cat"` and `'cat'` is the same thing

# Basic code features

Assignment uses .color-orange[**`=`**] and comparison uses .color-orange[**`==`**]

- For numbers .color-orange[`+ - * / %`] are as expected.
    - Special use of `+` for string concatenation.
- Logical operators are words (`and`, `or`, `not`) 
- The first assignment to a variable creates it.
- Variable types donâ€™t need to be declared.
	- Python figures out the variable types on its own.
- .color-orange[`#`] inserts a comment

---
class: compact
# Beware of the whitespace!
Whitespace and indentation (placement of newlines) is crucial in python
- The first line with less indentation is outside of the block
- The first line with more indentation starts a nested block
- Often a colon appears at the start of a new block (e.g for function and class definitions)

```
if z == 3.45 or y == 'Hello':
    x = x + 1         #Inside the if statement
    print(x)
    y = y + ' World' # Still inside
    print(y)

k = y+' outside' # Outside if
print(k)
```

---
# Type casting

You can check the type of an expression by the `type` command:
```python
type(2)
type(True)
```
You can change the type of an expression in Python; this is called **type-casting** 
- E.g: You can convert an `int` to a `float` or a `string` to an `int`

```Python
float(2) : 2.0
int("1") : 1
```

---

# Mathematical operations

Common mathematical operations are supported
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication division

```python
123 + 22 + 64 + 35  :   244
10 - 5              :   5
10 * 5              :   50
25 / 5              :   5.0  # Division results in float
25 / 4              :   6.25
25 // 4             :   6  # Division results in int
```

---

# Operations on strings

```python
# Select elements of a string in steps
a_name = 'Leonardo Da Vinci'
a_name[::2]

# Length of string
len(a_name)        :  17

# Adding strings
a_name + ' was a polymath'
```

Backslashes: `(\t \n \\)` for tab, newline and `\`. Try out useful commands:
```python
upper(), replace(<input>,<replacement>), find(<string>), lower(), strip()
```

---

# Operations on strings

Split function

```Python
name_toSplit = 'Leonardo Da Vinci'
name_toSplit.split() # splits by space and produces a list
name_toSplit.split('a') # splits by 'a' and produces a list
```

---

# Tuples
**Tuples** are an ordered sequence of comma separated elements within `()`
```python
a = ('python', 5.3, 10)

# Select an element
a[0]    :  'python'
a[-3]   :  'python'

# add two tuples together
b=('conda', 88, 55)
a + b   :   ('python', 5.3, 10, 'conda', 88, 55)
```

Tuples are **immutable**, which means we can't change them.<br> i.e b[0] = 1 does not work!

---

# Tuples

```python
# sorting by number
num_muons = (10,9,6,5,10,8,9,6,2)
sorted(num_muons)
```
Tuples can contain other tuples. Then you can access deeper elements by more []
```python
c = (10, 55, ('conda','anaconda','miniconda'), 3.14 )
print(c[2])
print(c[2][1])
print(c[2][1][0])
```

---

# Lists

Same as **tuples** except:
- comma separated elements within `[]`. 
- They are **mutable** which means you change them, i.e b[0] = 1 is allowed!

--

When we set one variable, `b` equal to `a`, both `a` and `b` are referencing the same list.
```python
a = [1, 2, 3] # a now references the list [1, 2, 3]
b = a # b now references what a references
a.append(4) # this changes the list a references
print (a)
print (b) 
```

---

# Lists

But you can override this behaviour is you create a clone of a list
```python
c = a[:] # b is a clone of a and points to different list
a.append(5) # this changes the list a references
print (a)
print (c) 
```

---

class: compact
# Sets

Sets are collections like lists and tuples but they are unordered:
- They do not record element position only have unique elements.
- They have only one of a particular element

```python
a = {'one','two','two','three'}
print (a)

{'one', 'two', 'three'}
```

Convert a list to a set using the `set()` function
```python

L= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]
S = set(L)

{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

---

# Operations on sets

Intersection
```python
set_1 = {'green','red','blue'}
set_2 = {'green','red','magenta','yellow'}
set_3 = set_1 & set_2
```

--

Union and subset
```python
set_3 = set_1.union(set_2) # Should return {'blue', 'green', 'magenta', 'red', 'yellow'}

set_1.issubset(set_3) # Should return True
```

---

# Dictionaries

Dictionaries store a mapping between a set of keys and a set of values.
- Keys should be unique and immutable
- Values can be any type or duplicates

You can define, modify, view, lookup, and delete the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
```
d = {'user':'dina', 'pwd':1234}
```
| key | value |
| --- | --- |
| `user` | `'dina'` |
| `pwd`  | `1234` |

---
class: compact
# Dictionaries
```Python
# replace a value of a key
d['user'] = 'dinos'

# add an element
d['age'] = 42

# list keys, values, pairs of keys-values
d.keys()  # List of keys
d.values()
d.items()

# delete an item 
del d['user']

# delete all
d.clear()
```

---

# Conditional statements

The `if` and `else` syntax is like this:
```
temperature=21
if temperature>17 and temperature<25:
	print('Not too warm not too cold')
elif temperature <= 17:
	print('It is cold')
else:
	print('Too hot!')
```

---
class: col-2, compact
# Loops
#### `for` loops
Notice the `enumerate` and `range`

```python
masses = [100,200,300]
for mass in masses:
	print('Mass',mass)

for i,mass in enumerate(masses):
	print('Point',i,'Mass',mass)

for i in range(0,10):
	print(i)

```

#### `while` loops
```
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

---

# Functions


```python
def my_test():
    var = 3
    print('In my_test',var)

my_test()
# print('Outside my_test',var) 
```

> `print(var)` creates a crash because `var` is out of scope. Try putting `global var` in the function and see what happens

---

# Classes

```python
class Circle(object):
    def __init__(self,radius,color):
        self.radius = radius
        self.color = color
```

___self___ : represents the instance of the class. Gives access to attributes and methods of the class

___init___ : like as a constructor in object oriented concepts. It is called when an object is created and initializes the attributes of the class

# What is Numpy?

.color-dodgerblue[Numpy](.color-dodgerblue[**Num**]erical .color-dodgerblue[**Py**]thon) is a library for scientific computing.
It contains among other things:
- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

It has advantages like speed an memory and is also the basis for .color-dodgerblue[**pandas**]

---

# What is Numpy?

A .color-dodgerblue["numpy"] array or .color-dodgerblue["ndarray"] is similar to a list. It's usually fixed in size and each
element is of the same type

Create an ndarray
```Py
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# you can also define the datatype of the array at creation. Look what happens in you select an int and have float values in it
another_array = np.array([3.14, 5, 6.4], dtype=np.int64)
print(another_array)
print(another_array.dtype)

# fix random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(123)
```

---
class: 

# Mathematical operations on arrays

It is very fast to do mathematical computations with numpy arrays rather than in simple python lists
```
v = np.array([1,0])
u = np.array([0,1])

# Addition
z = v+u

# adding a constant
w = z + 1 

# multiplication by scalar
w = 2*z 
```

---

# Mathematical operations on arrays

```
# multiplication of 2 arrays (done element wise)
q = z * w 
```
dot product is done as<br>
`q = np.dot(z,w)` i.e $$z^{T}w$$

# Useful numpy functions

>a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])<br>
a.mean()<br>
a.max()<br>
np.pi <br>
np.sin(a)<br>

--

>\# very useful when defining bins in plots<br>
x = np.linspace(0.2 * np.pi,100) <br>

--

>y = np.sin(x)<br>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
%matplotlib inline<br>
plt.plot(x,y)<br>

class: compact

# 2-D arrays

You can also define 2 dimensional arrays in numpy. For example:
```
a=np.array([ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ])

[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

a.ndim # number of nested lists - array dimension
2

a.shape # returns a tuple (num of nested lists(rows), num of elements in each list(columns))
(3,3)

a.size # number of elements ( rows x columns)
9
```
---
class: compact

# 2-D arrays


**You can think of a ROOT TTree containing variables as a NumPy array where every .color-red[row] is a different .color-red[event] and every .color-dodgerblue[column] is a different .color-dodgerblue[variable]**
```python
a=np.array([ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ])
b=np.array([ [10,11,12], [13,14,15], [16,17,18] ])

Try:
a+b
a-b
a*b
2*a
```
But if you want pure matrix multiplication you have to do:
```
np.dot(a,b)
```

# Supervised Learning - How does it work?

![](LearningFlowGeneral.png# center )

Our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function .color-darkorchid[**`h`**] :  \\(X \rightarrow Y\\) so that .color-darkorchid[**`h(x)`**] is a good predictor for the corresponding value of .color-limegreen[`y`]. 

.color-darkorchid[**`h(x)`**]  is called hypothesis(model).
